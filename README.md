## Description
- This program checks a [gtu website](https://www.gtu.ac.in) for new notifications and sends an email to a list of people if a new notification is found. It uses a web-scraping library to extract the notification information from the website, and sends the email. The program also remembers the link to the last notification that it found so that it can check if a new notification has been posted since the last time it was run.
